TUTORIAL OVERVIEW
---
What is AngularJS? It is one of the leading framework for building large JavaScript applications that are easy to maintain.

It makes the development faster because we can implement useful concepts like dependency injection, two-way data binding, reusable code and unit testing.

This tutorial will focus on creating, reading, updating, deleting and searching database records. We will do it using AngularJS and Angular Material as it's user interface component.

JSON data will be handled by the REST API built using PHP.
